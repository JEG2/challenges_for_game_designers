# Pick It Up

I've been playing games like [The Counting Kingdom](http://store.steampowered.com/app/302750/?snr=1_7_15__13) with my little girl lately, so I have math games on my mind.  I feel like one of the things that helped me get fast at basic math was learning to count Cribbage hands.  I'm tempted to combine these things in a game.

The super minimal story would be that a deck of cards has been dropped on the floor and you now have to walk out Cribbage hands, picking up cards as you go.  I would draw this as a set of tiles with one card per tile and a player standing in the middle.  The player would move around the board and cards would be added to hands.  Each set of [five cards would be scored](http://www.rubl.com/rules/cribbage-hand-score.html).

The number of hands collected would set the difficulty (and the length of your walk) since you would need to think ahead a bit and ensure that you're going end up standing in a place where you can still make decent hands.

Players would take turns going first, but would be given the same board to make things fair.  This means that ties could be possible.  I'm not sure how common of a problem that would be.  If it's common the game might not be fun.

I think I would make the board nine by nine, so there's a middle tile and some dead squares players might need to walk around.  Taking a step into an empty square would forfeit a card for that hand.

This isn't meant to be a deep game by any stretch.  It count help you practice basic math though and fans of Cribbage puzzles would probably enjoy it.
