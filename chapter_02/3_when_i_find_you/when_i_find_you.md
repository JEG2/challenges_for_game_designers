# When I Find Youâ€¦

As a space exploration addict, I'm obsessed with every rover and lander launch.  We're using more and more robotic exploration because it's so much more practical and simulating robots is good fun.  It seems to me that this could be a good topic to explore in a game.

Players would be based on some planet in a proceedurally generated cosmos.  From this location, they would build exploration vessels.  Each vessel could have some set of hardware giving it certain capabilities.  These would allow it to reach more exotic places.  For example, heat shields might be needed to explore planets near a star and avoidance systems could help to dodge asteroids and debris rings.

I love the idea of having the vessels use a preprogrammed intelligence.  This would be the main element of the game, building the logic that the vessels use to navigate further and further from your location.  I would create a visual programming language that allows players to scan surroundings, maneuver the vessel, radio results home, etc.

This would be a multiplayer game with two players in the same cosmos racing to out explore each other.  I think I would have them play as competing corporations on the same world, so distances and obstacles affect them the same.  You could have limited information about what your opponent is launching, like a number of vessels and their initial direction.  You would never know what their programming is though.

I think a simple score counter could be used to track progress, with each side earning more points based on the difficulty of their discoveries.  The final goal would be to reach a specific score before your opponent.

If score is handled as money, it might combine well with research and production mechanics.  You could afford to develop bigger projects as you begin reaching interesting destinations.

My biggest concern with this game is if there's enough meat here to engage players.  I would like to have exploration itself be enough of an interesting reward without having to resort to gimmicks like escaping a dying planet.  I'm hoping things like realizing you lost contact with some vessel would lead to interesting choices like:  do I avoid that area or try to send a much more carefully designed probe to figure out what happened?

I think this may be a game where some of the non-programming elements could have a big impact.  If discoveries are accompanied by gorgeous graphics, for example, this could add a bit to the appeal of the process.  Obviously, the mechanics themselves have to be interesting enough to make players want to keep going, but I think a high production value might get players to try things long enough to see if that is actually the case.
