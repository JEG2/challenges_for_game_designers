# It's Mine

I've long wanted to do a remake of an old game I liked, with some upgrades.  At it's heart the original game was just _territorial acquisition_ through a strategy game lens.

## The Original

The game I want to redo was called Lost Souls.  It was a Mac game put out by Spiderweb software.  I believe it was made by Richard White.  It's almost hard to prove this game existed using modern day Google.

If the game had a story it didn't stick with me but it took place on an isometric collection of land tiles seemingly floating in space.  Since you played a wizard manipulating troops on this field, I think of it as the place they teleport away to when they need to settle some score via a duel.

Anyway, wizards summoned in troops, using their _mana_, on tiles they controlled.  Each side begin with some tiles for this purpose.  Troops could then spread into other tiles.  Just stepping onto an unoccupied tile added it to the tiles controlled by that troop's wizard.  At the beginning of each new turn, wizards also received additional mana based on the number of tiles they now control.

The goal of the game was to control all of the tiles, but, even before the end, spreading out gave you more mana to work with and more choices for where you could strategically place troops.  The game was definitely a land grab.

Wizards could summon pawns, knights, and archers.  Each piece had different movement and/or different rules about how it captured other pieces.  Wizards could also summon bridge tiles, to reach isolated areas of land or create new path to tiles.

The tiles themselves had some variety.  There where open grasslands which were the tiles you could own.  Bridge tiles could be walked on, but not owned.  Towers could be owned by the latest wizard who touched them, but not walked on.  Towers also gave a sizable mana bonus compared to grasslands.  Finally trees could not be owned or traversed.

## What I Would Like to Do

Lost Souls was fun, but not rich in variety.  It wasn't multiplayer (that I recall), so a simple AI played competing wizards.  What variety it did have came from the various maps you could play on, but once you got the hang of the AI you could best it in pretty much any scenario.

Obviously, I would do this as a multiplayer title.  It cries out to be played across the board from an opponent with a very chess like feel.

The other major bit I want to add is different types of wizards you can play.  The wizard in Lost Souls feels a bit like a druid that draws strength from the land, but I can imagine other archetypes.  Necromancers might drain the land as they call forth minions, forcing them to seek new tiles and eventually exhausting their supplies.  Geomancers might summon worker minions that mine some type of force from the tiles, allowing their wizard to power bigger creations.  I would also like a type not dependent on tiles.  Perhaps Summoner could pay for their minions with a time-to-summon mechanic, with more powerful minions taking much longer.  Or a bloodmage might destroy minions, there's or the opponents, to gain power, yet pay some balancing upkeep cost to keep units on the field.

Another axis of variety for the different wizards could be the troops they summon.  I could see bats that fly and don't need bridges, but also don't touch tiles.  Golems might vary in power (which could be the number of hits they can take), depending on how much was used to summon them.  Undead might be stronger on drained lands.  These are just some ideas.

The final change I would probably make it to put the wizards on the board, like a chess king, instead of keeping them as an imagined presence.  I realize this changes the dynamic a little (towards something like _capture the flag_, I assume), but territory acquisition would still be a key component, just as it is in chess.  Without the change, the end game can drag on as a wizard struggles to reach every last tile, even when they've obviously already won.  Also, this plays well with wizard varieties.  For example, necromancers might only be able to drain adjacent tiles.

If I built this game, I would be careful to do it in steps.  The first is to get the game working with **one** kind of wizard.  This is a fine start.  I would then slowly introduce new playable wizards one at a time.

The primary struggle would be to keep things balanced.  With the wizards fueling up in different ways and tossing out different troops, much care is needed to make sure each new type is equally playable.
