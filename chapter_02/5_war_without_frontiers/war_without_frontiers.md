# War Without Frontiers

I decided to interpret "Civil War" in the generic sense for this challenge, instead of some specific event.  While civil wars result in literal warfare, I assume they are started by a split in ideologies.  Each side is ultimately trying to convince the other side to accept their beliefs.  I think it could be fun to battle over this capturing of beliefs.

I was trying to decide how to represent this struggle without drawing out a map and coloring in sections.  We don't want territory involved.  This got me thinking about using something like poll results.  You probably have three main groups:  one for each of the two sides and a smaller third group rejecting both major positions.  In each group, you could probably further divide people into casual believers and the fundamentalists who would be very hard to budge.  This is a gross simplification, of course, but probably enough to play with.

Now we need outlets that could be used to sway the people.  I'm thinking I would use groups like government, news, education, and entertainment.  I like the idea of each outlet having different strengths.  For example, education might strongly move a lot of people, but I envision it as being slow to enact.  It takes time to teach students and then get them into the system.

Both sides would have budgets.  For some set period of time, they could determine how much of their budget to put in each outlet.  At the end of that period, the current polls are shown.  Budgets then refresh and the cycle repeats.

I guess this is largely a political simulation.  It may need some more gamey elements to really be fun to play.
