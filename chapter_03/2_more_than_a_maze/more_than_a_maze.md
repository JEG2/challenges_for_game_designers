# More Than a Maze

* In a space pirate game, the goal could be to get specific cargos off of various ships.  One option available in the planning stage of a heist could be to send someone into the ship using some excuse.  That spy would see whatever they could see walking through the ship to their fake destination.  Some doors might be open or labeled, for example.  Then during the actual caper, you would need to target places on the hull of the ship to fire at, land boarding parties, etc.  If you made a map while you were in there, it could inform these decisions.
* What about a game where you have a map given to you, bug you gradually begin to notice that it lies?  I'm imagining a society like that in the "The Giver" where those in power are trying to keep some information from the general populace.  Part of this policy could be a casual hiding of some location, just by failing to show them on maps.  Players could then learn to mistrust the provide map and start keeping their own.
* In a space exploration game, the systems of planets could be laid out in some conventional way, like on a hex grid.  However, some systems may be joined by one way "wormholes" that can jump to another location across the star map.  This can make some systems very strategic locations if they have normal entrances plus wormholes escape hatches.  (This is, roughly, a mechanic from TradeWars 2002.)
