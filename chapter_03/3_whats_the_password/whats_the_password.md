# What's the Password?

My main idea here was playing with a code formed from the player's actions in a level.  I envision this being used in some kind of combat training simulation where the code is for an exit to an obstacle course.  My thought is that this could encourage players to be more aware of their surroundings, which seems fitting if they are supposedly in training.

## Determine the Code

The code is three numbers, each one pulled from a detail of the obstacle course.  Examples:

* Starting ammunition
* Spent ammunition
* Opponents subdued
* Total weapons in course
* Bunkers in course
* Snipers avoided

The code changes as the course is being played, dependent on these details.

## Determine How the Player Enters the Code

When the player reaches the exit for the course, there are three rows of controls to the side.  Each row has a keypad for entry, a screen showing the number entered, and a label showing the statistic involved.

## Determine How the Player Gets the Code in the First Place

If the player remembers or can calculate the indicated numbers upon reaching the exit, they may enter and proceed.  If the player doesn't know the needed details, they may need to work back through the course, counting what they missed.

The player cannot know which details will be used until they reach the door.  Not having the needed facts at that time could lengthen their time on the course and possibly hurt their score.
