# A Shocking Puzzle

It kind of bothers me when I can just fiddle with things like electrical current puzzles until I find the perfect mix, with little or no consequences.  Given that, I want to build the opposite.

My electricity based puzzles would be such that you are trying to pass a specific amount of current from one side to the other.  If you pass too little, there's no effect and you could safely try again.  However, if you ever put more current into any piece than it can tolerate, it is destroyed.  This means you fail the puzzle and must take some (longer, harder, etc.) alternate route in the game.

I would design the circuits so that the flow of current is already predetermined.  There would also be various places rated for how much current they can handle.  Boards might have preplaced chips like:

* Start:  the initial source of current at a fixed amount
* Limit:  only allows a fixed amount of current
* Gate:  requires a current in one side to open passage via another side
* Device:  the goal at the end requiring some amount of current

The player would then try to solve the puzzle by adding certain chips that complete the circuit.  Player placed chips could include things like:

* Resistor:  reduce a current by a fixed amount
* Fork:  split a current in two
* Merge:  unite two currents into one

You can build some fairly complex puzzles with just these pieces.  A couple of examples are attached.
