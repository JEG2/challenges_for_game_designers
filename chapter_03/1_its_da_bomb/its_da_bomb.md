# It's Da Bomb

## Spatial Reasoning

To me the sort of classical feel for a bomb disarming puzzle would be following some series of steps flawlessly.  I think many of these steps are commonly spacial in nature.  For example, "unscrew and slide off the face plate" and "isolate and cut the red wire."

This version of the puzzle would show you the device and allow you to interact with it in various ways.  Most steps would involve some spacial manipulations with built-in tolerances, meaning that over or under doing some move could cost you time or worse.  This requires precision and precision is generally slow and careful, but the clock is pressing you to move faster.

## Pattern Recognition

Let's say MacGyver has a book of bomb disarm codes.  Looking at the bomb on one side of the screen, he can rifle through the book on the other side.  The goal would be to compare details of the bomb (shape of devices, number, placement, and color of wires, style of entry pad, etc.) with images in the book.  One image from the book will match, but all others will have random variations.  The player needs to find the one matching image and enter the code before time expires, but the timer needs to be low enough that the player has only a few seconds to examine each image.  I'm hoping to capture some of the same pressure I feel when I play _Papers, Please_ with this approach.

## Item Use

If you want to capture the flavor of MacGyver, it seems like it would be tough to beat an item use puzzle.  That's what he did!  It could be fun to pick from [a list of actual solutions in the show](http://macgyver.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_problems_solved_by_MacGyver) and use a subset of those as a way to disarm the bomb.  Some interactions with the clock could be to make certain tasks take multiple tries, eating seconds with each attempt.
